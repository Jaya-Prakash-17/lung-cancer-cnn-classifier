# Models Directory

## Overview

This directory is intended to store the pre-trained model weights used for the Lung Cancer Classification project utilizing the VGG-19 architecture. Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the `.h5` model files are not included in this repository.

## Download Model Weights

The model weights required for this project can be downloaded from the following link on Kaggle:

[Download Model Weights from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp1708/model-weights/data)

## Instructions

1. **Download the Model Files**:
   - Go to the provided Kaggle link and download the necessary `.h5` files.

2. **Place the Model Files**:
   - After downloading, place the `.h5` files into this `models` directory so they can be used by the project's scripts.

## File Structure

Once you have downloaded and placed the files, the `models` directory should look like this:

models/  
│  
├── rescaling-weights.h5  
├── rescaling-97.93.h5  
└── (any other model files you have)  


## Important Notes

- Ensure that the filenames match those referenced in your project code.
- If you encounter any issues with downloading or placing the model files, please refer to the project's main documentation or contact the repository maintainers.
